# This is a command line tool for analyzing The Elder Scrolls: Legends decks.
All of the analysis functionality can be run on the test deck (`./deck.json`) by running `pipenv run python deck_analyzer.py`.
I'm using Python 3.6 to develop.

All of the simulation functionality can be run via `pipenv run python main.py`
